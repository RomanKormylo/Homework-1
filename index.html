<h2>
    HyperText Markup Language
</h2>
    <p>
        <em>In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, then a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE</em>, <br>
        a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system.<br>
        Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert<br>
        Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN.<br>
        In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an encyclopedia first.<br>
        The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee <br>
        in late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag,<br>
        these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. <br>
        Eleven of these elements still exists in HTML 4."
